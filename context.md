# Go fish for a team mate
This is a web site where you get to randomly pick a team member based on the saying "Go Fish". Here you will literally
have to fish for a new team member.

# Scenario
Two teams will be set up, one team will fish while the other team will be the fish itself. After having set up the teams, 
a random player will be assigned as fisherman. A big button with the caption "GO FISH" will be available to the player.
When pressed, the fisherman will cast a line and after max 10 seconds a fish will get caught on the line. A name of a member
of the "fish" team will then be picked and the fisherman and the caught fish will team up.

# Endgame
After all the fishermen are done and all the fish has been fished up, a list should be displayed containing the pairs of 
fishermen and fish that we ended up with. The player should have an option to play again.

# Tech stack
 The choice of technology is up to you, but if we can keep it to plain html, css and javascript, that would be great!
